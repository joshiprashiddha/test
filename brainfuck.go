/*
Requirements:
• Make it stack-based.

    This should mean that every loop must be in stack one level below current.

    For example for script ‘+[-]-’ it could mean that operations would be as such:
    “add +1, run loop, sub 1”, where “run loop” includes necessary operations and actions inside.
    Nested loops must be supported.

• Make it read input from io.Reader without knowing all input at once.

    This requirement excludes look-ahead. For example to find closing bracket for loops.
    As such next token should be read and processed only after current one is finished processing.
    Loops preparation might be using the same process to fill them. This means whilst creating a loop – it can read necessary tokens from the input, while still adhering to this rule.

• Make it a library.

    Other developers must be able to import this library and use it from inside their code.
    This means that all necessary functionality MUST be exported and freely available to developer.

• Make it extensible.

    Have functionality(functions/methods) to add and remove custom operations at runtime, before parsing the input.
    No synchronization required: developers will add/remove operations only before parsing any script.
    For example if developer that will use this library would want to add another operation(to square current cell value for example) to it – he MUST be able to do that. Same for removing operations.
